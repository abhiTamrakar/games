programmatic games, just for fun

In its first release, I chose shell (my fav scripting language), check under bash_games.
## i-always-win.sh
### A game where computer always wins, of course you can try to find the possibility if you can win. good luck with that.. :p

## tic-tac-toe.sh
### A legendary and famous game, it was already available with its AI in python, C# and Java, so I decided to take the challenge on shell. :)

## minesweeper.sh
### Another legendary game, it was also available in python and C, So again, took it to bash.
